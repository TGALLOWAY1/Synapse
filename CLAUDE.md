# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Synapse — "From plain-language to product blueprint" — is an AI-native product
definition environment that transforms a plain-language prompt into a
structured PRD, then into UI mockups, downstream artifacts (screen inventory,
data model, etc.), and visual annotations. The product workspace is a fully
client-side React SPA — all PRD/branch/artifact state persists in
localStorage via Zustand. A separate Vercel-hosted backend (under `api/`)
powers a recruiter-portal sub-product with OAuth, MongoDB, and snapshot
storage; do not confuse it with the PRD workspace.

## Documentation rule

**Keep this file in sync with the code in the same change.** Whenever you
add, remove, or meaningfully alter architecture, data flow, state slices,
the LLM pipeline, domain types, or a cross-cutting pattern (e.g. the PRD
selection pipeline), update the relevant section of CLAUDE.md as part of
the same commit — do not leave it for a follow-up. If a change makes an
existing description wrong, fix the description; if it introduces a
pattern others must follow or must not break, document it here as a rule.
Treat docs drift as a defect in the change itself.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # tsc -b && vite build (TS check is part of build)
npm run lint         # ESLint flat config, TS/TSX only
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm test             # vitest run (one-shot)
npx vitest <file>    # Run a single test file in watch mode
npx tsc --noEmit     # Type-check without emitting
```

Tests live in `src/lib/__tests__/` and `api/_lib/__tests__/`. There is no
Playwright suite despite the dev dependency.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7
- Tailwind CSS 3 + tailwind-merge + clsx
- Zustand 5 with `persist` middleware (debounced localStorage)
- Google Gemini API called directly from the browser; key in localStorage
- React Router v7 (workspace, recruiter portal, admin pages, /about, /privacy)
- Deployed to Vercel (SPA + Node serverless functions under `api/`)

## Architecture

### Two parallel sub-products

This repo holds **two separate products** that share the Vite build but
otherwise have nothing in common — keep that distinction in mind:

1. **PRD workspace** (the "real" Synapse product) — `src/components/HomePage.tsx`
   and `src/components/ProjectWorkspace.tsx` mounted at `/` and
   `/p/:projectId`. State is 100% client-side localStorage. Calls Gemini
   directly. Never touches the `api/` backend.

2. **Recruiter portal** — `src/components/LoginPage.tsx`,
   `src/components/RecruiterAdminPage.tsx`, mounted at `/admin/recruiters`
   plus the `/api/auth/*`, `/api/session`, `/api/activity`,
   `/api/snapshots`, `/api/admin/recruiters` endpoints. Server-side state
   in MongoDB; OAuth via Google/GitHub/LinkedIn; auth glue lives in
   `src/lib/recruiterApi.ts` and `src/lib/snapshotClient.ts`. Backend
   handlers are in `api/` (Node serverless), with shared helpers in
   `api/_lib/`.

### LLM layer (`src/lib/`)

- **`geminiClient.ts`** — low-level Gemini transport. Two modes:
  `callGemini()` (sync JSON) and `callGeminiStream()` (SSE). Both wrap fetch
  in `fetchWithRetry` for connection-level transient errors;
  `callGeminiStream` *also* wraps the entire fetch+reader in a stream-level
  retry, so a mid-stream mobile-network drop reconnects from byte zero.
  Stream callers should implement `StreamCallbacks.onRestart` to reset any
  chunk-derived state (char counters, phase trackers) when the stream is
  re-attempted. `isRetryableNetworkError` is exported for callers that
  need to reason about retry policy.

- **`services/`** — one file per AI feature. Importing through the
  `llmProvider.ts` barrel keeps legacy call sites stable.
  - `prdService.ts` + `prdPipeline.ts` — PRD generation. Pipeline is now
    **single-pass**: Pass A streams a structured PRD (Gemini JSON mode with
    `prdSchemas.structuredPRDSchema`) with the quality rubric baked into
    the system prompt; markdown is rendered deterministically from the
    JSON via `prdMarkdownRenderer.ts`. The legacy multi-pass scoring +
    revision passes were removed — old projects in localStorage retain
    their saved `qualityScores`, but no new generation writes them.
  - `mockupService.ts` + `mockupImageService.ts` — mockup HTML and image
    generation.
  - `coreArtifactService.ts` — the 7 core artifact types
    (screen_inventory, data_model, component_inventory, user_flows,
    implementation_plan, prompt_pack, design_system). Three of these
    (screen/data/component inventory) use Gemini JSON mode with schemas in
    `schemas/artifactSchemas.ts`, then convert to markdown via
    `structuredArtifactToMarkdown()` for storage; renderers in
    `src/components/renderers/` parse that markdown back to card layouts.
  - `branchService.ts` — branch consolidation back into the spine.
  - `artifactJobController.ts` — concurrency control for artifact bundle
    generation.
- **`prompts/prdPrompts.ts`** — strategy system instruction; the
  `RUBRIC_DEFINITION` "quality bar" is appended so Pass A self-targets the
  rubric in its first response.

### State (`src/store/`)

`useProjectStore` is one Zustand store composed from 8 slices in
`src/store/slices/`:

- `projectSlice` — Project CRUD, current stage
- `spineSlice` — SpineVersion CRUD, structured PRD updates, generation
  errors. Branches fork from highlighted spine text and consolidate
  back via `branchService.consolidateBranch()`. Spine versioning uses
  `isLatest`/`isFinal` flags.
- `branchSlice` — Branches and their messages
- `artifactSlice` — Artifacts + ArtifactVersions; preferred-version
  tracking; source-ref staleness detection against the current spine
- `feedbackSlice` — FeedbackItems with intent classification
- `stalenessSlice` — Staleness checks
- `generationJobsSlice` — Per-project job tracking (transient; stripped
  from persistence)
- `prdProgressSlice` — Live progress event log for the PRD generation UI
  (transient; stripped from persistence). Consecutive-duplicate-deduped.

The store's `partialize` strips `jobs` and `prdProgress` so they don't
persist. `onRehydrateStorage` migrates legacy `currentStage` values
(`devplan`/`prompts`/`mockups`/`artifacts` → `prd` or `workspace`).

### Pipeline flow

```
User prompt → HomePage.handleCreateProject() → generateStructuredPRD()
              ↓
              Pass A streams structured JSON → onPartial paints draft
              ↓
              SpineVersion stored, currentStage='prd'
  PRD stage:       SelectableSpine / StructuredPRDView — text selection →
                   branch creation → AI conversation → consolidateBranch()
                   merges into spine (local or doc-wide scope, see
                   ConsolidationModal). Selection → action dialog runs
                   through the shared touch-aware pipeline (see "PRD
                   highlight → branch selection pipeline" below).
  Workspace stage: ArtifactsView (bundle/individual gen, refine, validate)
                   + MockupsView (platform/fidelity/scope config)
                   + MarkupImageView (MarkupImageSpec → SVG via
                   MarkupImageRenderer)
  History stage:   HistoryView — chronological timeline with diffs
```

### PRD highlight → branch selection pipeline

The core PRD-refinement gesture — highlight PRD text, get a contextual
action dialog (Clarify / Expand / Specify / Alternative / Replace), spawn
a history-tracked branch — is detection-source-agnostic and works on
both desktop and touch. Both PRD renderers (`SelectableSpine.tsx` for
markdown PRDs, `StructuredPRDView.tsx` for structured PRDs) share one
pipeline; do not reintroduce per-component `onMouseUp` selection logic.

- **`src/lib/selectionPopover.ts`** — pure, framework-free helpers:
  `isValidSelection` (rejects null / collapsed / empty / out-of-container
  selections), `getSelectionInfo` (text + bounding rect), and
  `computePopoverPosition` (viewport clamp + flip-above math for the
  desktop popover). These are unit-tested in isolation.
- **`src/lib/useSelectionPopover.ts`** — the React hook owning detection.
  Listens on `document` for **`pointerup`** (mouse/pen/touch, short read
  delay) *and* **`selectionchange`** (debounced — the mobile long-press +
  drag-handle route, which never fires a matching `mouseup`). Validates
  against a `containerRef`; a *collapsing* selection never auto-dismisses
  an open dialog (focusing the mobile input collapses the native range) —
  dismissal is explicit via `clear()`.
- **`src/lib/useIsMobile.ts`** — `matchMedia` hook at the Tailwind `md`
  breakpoint (jsdom-safe).
- **`src/components/SelectionActionDialog.tsx`** — shared presentation:
  desktop = floating popover anchored to the selection rect; mobile =
  bottom sheet with `env(safe-area-inset-*)` insets and ≥44px tap
  targets. Both call the same branch handlers — there is no parallel
  edit path. The branch/history flow itself (`createBranch` →
  `replyInBranch` → `addBranchMessage`) is unchanged by this layer.

`index.html` carries `viewport-fit=cover` so safe-area insets resolve on
notched devices.

### Progress UI (`src/components/GenerationProgress.tsx`)

Long-running LLM operations show a stages panel. The component supports
three drive modes, in priority order:

1. **State-driven** (`progress` prop is a number) — bar tracks the value
   directly, timer disabled.
2. **History-driven** (`history` prop is non-empty) — prominent label and
   stage-dot index derive from the latest progress message by
   first-three-words substring match against stage labels; walks
   backwards through history if the latest message is transient
   ("Connection dropped — retrying…", "Sending request to model…")
   so the indicator doesn't yank to the wrong stage.
3. **Timer-driven** (fallback) — labels rotate on `minDuration` timers.

When supplying `history`, the stage label strings in
`generationStages.ts` must be a substring-prefix match for the strings
emitted via `onProgress` for the indicator to track. Don't include
mutable detail (char counts, timestamps) in progress messages — that
defeats the store's consecutive-dedupe and floods the history list.

### Domain types

`src/types/index.ts` is the single source of truth for the domain model
(Project, SpineVersion, Branch, Artifact, ArtifactVersion, FeedbackItem,
HistoryEvent, etc.). Keep optional fields optional even when only one
code path uses them — legacy localStorage data may not have them.
